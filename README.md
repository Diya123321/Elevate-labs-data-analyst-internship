For data Pre-Processing I have choosen a dataset from kaggle.com named as "Netflix_Titles.csv"
<br>it consists of 11 columns named as show-id,name,type,duration etc
to clean this data i have used python libraries like numpy and pandas in jupyter notebook.Some of the steps which I have done in oder to clean and preprocess the dataset are:<br>
Removing NULL values<br>
Dealing with missing values <br>
Changing the data types into single data type<br>
Removing the repeated values <br>
Removing the unwanted columns from the dataset<br>
This was a greta task for understanding Data Cleaning and Data Pre-Processing.
